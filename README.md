Virtualized List with "scroll" event Listener.

A virtualized list with scroll event listener for studies purposes. 

I started trying to make this with "mousewheel" event, but it became to complicated to read the deltaY property and also the manual scroll didn't dispatched the mousewheel event. 

Trying to go around it, I change the attempts to starting listening the "scroll" event, which made my life a lot easier and it was faster to implement.
